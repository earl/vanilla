<h3>Huh? What's that? It works! Welcome to Vanilla {script-version}!</h3>And that's an almost empty space. It's just like a blank sheet o' paper. And that always inspired your creativity, right? Because then you're the perfect Vanillian!

I've removed all app-specific snips (e.g. for vanilla-naju and vanilla-du-jour) from the space at this time in order to speed up the release process. If you want to know how the apps work, have a look at their source (hey, it's REBOL, after all) and how they are used at the "master space" reachable at *http://iw2.infowerk.co.at/cgi-bin/vanilla.r* while you're there.

You can dive deeper into all things Vanilla at *http://www.langreiter.com/vanilla*. It's certainly a great idea to <strike>jump into</strike> join vanilla-pudding, the funky Vanilla mailing list.
