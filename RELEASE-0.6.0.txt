
			synerge vanilla/R version 0.6.0

  Release Notes
  -------------

  After years and years (and, uhm, years) of hard and diligent work we are proud
  to release the hitherto longest-awaited Vanilla release ever: 0.6!  It shines
  like no Vanilla has before, no, it really radiates joy and happiness!  As for
  the endless listing of new features and fixed bugs (bugs?), we kindly redirect
  you to the attached comprehensive change log, from which we liberally excerpt
  the following highlights:

  - Snip attachments: This single new feature brings a whole new dimension of
    usefulness (in addition to the already present 7 dimensions!) to Vanilla.
    Some early users are rumored to have abandoned the file system completely
    for the bright new world of snip attachments.

  - Easily installable VanillaVista package (see
    <URL:http://www.vanillasite.at/space/howto-vanilla-vista).

  - Vastly improved documentation. (Please keep any comments à la "zero is a
    great starting point for vast improvements" to yourself.)

  - Profound deployment improvements (cleaned-up and simplified configuration,
    CGI wrapper script).
 
  - The  name of the start snip is now configurable.

  As most of you surely happen to know, the period from 2001-12-13 up to today
  was, from an astrological point of view, not well-suited for product releases
  of any  kind. We did consult with international softwarereleasology experts as
  well, and they, as we did expect, did only confirm what the stars, our
  friends, were already telling us.

  Furthermore, Vanilla is like high-quality, expensive wine (i.e. the kind which
  is not available in Tetrapackaging [yet] - albeit Vanilla available in Tetra
  Paks might be worth some pondering, but not now - as that pondering might
  further delay what has been delayed, let's be frank for once, the odd year too
  long already. So - what was I talking about? Ah! Wine!): It only gets better
  the longer it can rest - but unlike your high-quality, expensive wine,
  Vanilla, and now listen, dear reader, still is free, like all the most
  precious things in life.

  Enjoy!
