
      synerge vanilla/R - Quick Installation Guide for Un*x-based Systems

 - This installation guide assumes that you have the Apache HTTPD webserver
   installed.
 
 - Extract the Vanilla unix distribution (vanilla-x.y.z.tar.gz) to a directory
   of your choice (e.g. /usr/local/vanilla/).

 - Download REBOL/Core from <URL:http://www.rebol.com/platforms.shtml>. You can
   use the direct link <URL:ftp://ftp.rebol.com/pub/downloads/core/rebol042> if
   you like.

 - Place rebol042 in a proper directory (e.g. /usr/local/bin/) and make it
   executable (e.g. chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rebol042).

 - Copy wrapper.cgi and vanilla.r.conf into Apache's cgi-bin directory.

 - Rename wrapper.cgi to vanilla.cgi and vanilla.r.conf to vanilla.cgi.conf.

 - Edit vanilla.cgi with your favorite text-editor and change the first line to
   point to your REBOL/Core executable (e.g. change it to
   #!/usr/local/bin/rebol042 -cs)

 - Execute chmod.sh in your vanilla root (e.g. 
   $ cd /usr/local/vanilla
   $ ./chmod.sh)

 - You're almost done! Edit vanilla.cgi.conf and adapt at least
   "vanilla-space-identifier" and "vanilla-root". 
   
   - Use some random string as "vanilla-space-identifier", for example the
     current date and time (e.g. vanilla-space-identifier: "2003-09-22 01:51").

   - "vanilla-root" must point to your Vanilla installation directory (e.g.
     vanilla-root: "/usr/local/vanilla/") Do not forget the trailing slash!
     (it must be "/usr/local/vanilla/" but not "/usr/local/vanilla").

 - That's it for now, you should now be able to access your Vanilla instance
   thru a browser, try <URL:http://localhost/cgi-bin/vanilla.cgi>.
