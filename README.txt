  What is it?
  -----------

  Vanilla is a simple, extensible hypertext system and framework for developing
  simple web-applications. 
  
  Vanilla's conceptual roots lie in Ward Cunningham's WikiWikiWeb, an idea
  Vanilla fully embraced.

  Through its extension mechanisms, Vanilla also provides Weblog functionality.
  This breed of software (wiki/weblog cross-over) is now commonly referred to
  as Bliki - and as far as we know Vanilla was the first of it's kind.
