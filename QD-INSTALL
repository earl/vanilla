	(the full and funky and obsolete edition is available at 
 	 http://www.langreiter.com/vanilla/INSTALL)

1. 	Download Apache (or any other web server with CGI capability).
   	http://www.apache.org/httpd.html
2. 	Download Rebol.
   	http://www.rebol.com
3. 	Install both. It's easy. Follow the instructions. Read the manuals.
4a. 	Place your vanilla.r, simplespace.r and vanilla.r.conf in the cgi-bin 
	directory of your beloved server software.
4b. 	Place vanilla.01-line.gif in the directory accessible via 
	http://localhost/vanilla (something like htdocs/vanilla).
5. 	Edit the first line of vanilla.r to point to your Rebol interpreter.
6. 	Copy the unzipped "vanilla" directory to c: (or d: or e:\games\retro\funky 
	or whatever) and modify the entries in vanilla.r.conf accordingly.
7. 	Chant "I love Vanilla very much!" eight times (loud!)
8. 	Fire up the browser of your choice and type, with trembling hands, 
	localhost/cgi-bin/vanilla.r
9. 	If everything works (something [...] appears on your screen), 
	immediately stand up and chant again! Jump around and shout to your 
	co-workers! Tell them about your emotions! Wooohaaaa! 
	Demand free beer for everyone!
10. 	If it doesn't work, well ... Hmmmmm .... Well, then wait. Do nothing. 
	Don't touch anything. Wait till I come to speak with you. Or someone else.
